Hello I have been learning python and as part of the training I am trying to do some learning module exercises and I am stuck on part 2 and 3 of these questions:

   

* **Part 1 -** Using a list, you will be required to calculate and print to the console the following information:
   * The number of students' marks in the data sample
   * The lowest and highest marks
   * The average mark, formatted to two decimal places  


For \^\^\^ I have completed part 1 with the following code: 

from statistics import mean

&#x200B;

def Average(l): 

avg = mean(l) 

return avg

&#x200B;

data=\[90,30,13,67,85,87,50,45,51,72,64,69,59,17,22,23,44,25,16,67,85,87,50,45,51,72,59,14,50,55,32,23,24,25,37,28,39,30,33,35,40,34,41,43,94,95,98,99,44,45,47,48,49,53,61,63,69,75,77,60,83\]

average = Average(data) 

print ("Calculating students marks...........")

print ("Total number of students marks are:",len(data))

print ("The highest students mark is:",max(data))

print ("The lowest students mark is:",min(data))

print("The average students mark is:", ("%.2f" % round(average)))  


I am stuck on these two and don't know where to start:

* **Part 2** \- you will be required to write code to process the data and calculate how many instances of marks in the categories shown below. Alongside each category you should print out one asterisk for each occurrence. As an example, the category 10-20 has four occurrences (13, 17, 16 & 14) and therefore has four asterisks, e.g.:
* **Part 3 -** Finally, you will be requested to calculate and print out what the pass mark should be to ensure that at least 60% of students will pass the exam. This should be to the nearest ten
